If Bulgaria or Romania has failed to implement commitments undertaken in the context of the accession negotiations, causing a serious breach of the functioning of the internal market, including any commitments in all sectoral policies which concern economic activities with cross-border effect, or an imminent risk of such breach the Commission may, until the end of a period of up to three years after accession, upon the motivated request of a Member State or on its own initiative, adopt European regulations or decisions establishing appropriate measures.
Measures shall be proportional and priority shall be given to measures which least disturb the functioning of the internal market and, where appropriate, to the application of the existing sectoral safeguard mechanisms.
Such safeguard measures shall not be invoked as a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between Member States.
The safeguard clause may be invoked even before accession on the basis of the monitoring findings and the measures adopted shall enter into force as of the first day of accession unless they provide for a later date.
The measures shall be maintained no longer than strictly necessary and, in any case, shall be lifted when the relevant commitment is implemented.
They may however be applied beyond the period specified in the first paragraph as long as the relevant commitments have not been fulfilled.
In response to progress made by the new Member State concerned in fulfilling its commitments, the Commission may adapt the measures as appropriate.
The Commission shall inform the Council in good time before revoking the European regulations and decisions establishing the safeguard measures, and it shall take duly into account any observations of the Council in this respect.

These measures may take the form of temporary suspension of the application of relevant provisions and decisions in the relations between Bulgaria or Romania and any other Member State or Member States, without prejudice to the continuation of close judicial cooperation.
The measures shall be maintained no longer than strictly necessary and, in any case, shall be lifted when the shortcomings are remedied.
They may however be applied beyond the period specified in the first paragraph as long as these shortcomings persist.
In response to progress made by the new Member State concerned in rectifying the identified shortcomings, the Commission may adapt the measures as appropriate after consulting the Member States.
Article 39
If, on the basis of the Commission's continuous monitoring of commitments undertaken by Bulgaria and Romania in the context of the accession negotiations and in particular the Commission's monitoring reports, there is clear evidence that the state of preparations for adoption and implementation of the acquis in Bulgaria or Romania is such that there is a serious risk of either of those States being manifestly unprepared to meet the requirements of membership by the date of accession of 1 January 2007 in a number of important areas, the Council may, acting unanimously on the basis of a Commission recommendation, decide that the date of accession of that State is postponed by one year to 1 January 2008.
Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the Council may, acting by qualified majority on the basis of a Commission recommendation, take the decision mentioned in paragraph 1 with respect to Romania if serious shortcomings have been observed in the fulfilment by Romania of one or more of the commitments and requirements listed in Annex IX, point I.
Notwithstanding paragraph 1, and without prejudice to Article 37, the Council may, acting by qualified majority on the basis of a Commission recommendation and after a detailed assessment to be made in the autumn of 2005 of the progress made by Romania in the area of competition policy, take the decision mentioned in paragraph 1 with respect to Romania if serious shortcomings have been observed in the fulfilment by Romania of the obligations undertaken under the Europe Agreement or of one or more of the commitments and requirements listed in Annex IX, point II.
In the event of a decision taken under paragraph 1, 2 or 3, the Council shall, acting by qualified majority decide immediately upon such adjustments to this Protocol, including its Annexes and Appendices, as have become indispensable by reason of the postponement decision.

Any person intending to import or market a pharmaceutical product covered by the above paragraph in a Member State where the product enjoys patent or supplementary protection shall demonstrate to the competent authorities in the application regarding that import that one month's prior notification has been given to the holder or beneficiary of such protection.
COMPETITION POLICY
Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, Part III, Title III, Chapter I, Section 5, Rules on competition
The following aid schemes and individual aid put into effect in a new Member State before the date of accession and still applicable after that date shall be regarded upon accession as existing aid within the meaning of Article III-168(1) of the Constitution:
aid measures put into effect before 10 December 1994;
aid measures listed in the Appendix to this Annex;
aid measures which prior to the date of accession were assessed by the State aid monitoring authority of the new Member State and found to be compatible with the acquis, and to which the Commission did not raise an objection on the ground of serious doubts as to the compatibility of the measure with the common market, pursuant to the procedure set out in paragraph 2.
All measures still applicable after the date of accession which constitute State aid and which do not fulfil the conditions set out above shall be considered as new aid upon accession for the purpose of the application of Article III-168(3) of the Constitution.
The above provisions do not apply to aid to the transport sector, nor to activities linked to the production, processing or marketing of products listed in Annex I to the Constitution with the exception of fisheries products and products derived thereof.
The above provisions shall also be without prejudice to the transitional measures regarding Competition Policy set out in the Protocol and the measures laid down in Annex VII, Chapter 4, Section B, to the Protocol.
To the extent that a new Member State wishes the Commission to examine an aid measure under the procedure described in paragraph 1(c), it shall provide the Commission regularly with:
a list of existing aid measures which have been assessed by the national State aid monitoring authority and which that authority has found to be compatible with the acquis; and
any other information which is essential for the assessment of the compatibility of the aid measure to be examined,
in accordance with the concrete reporting format provided by the Commission.
If the Commission does not object to the existing aid measure on the ground of serious doubts as to the compatibility of the measure with the common market, within 3 months of receipt of complete information on that measure or of receipt of the statement of the new Member State in which it informs the Commission that it considers the information provided to be complete because the additional information requested is not available or has been already provided, the Commission shall be deemed not to have raised an objection.
All aid measures submitted under the procedure described in paragraph 1(c) prior to the date of accession to the Commission are subject to the above procedure irrespective of the fact that in the period of examination the new Member State concerned has already become member of the Union.
A Commission decision to object to a measure, within the meaning of paragraph 1(c), shall be regarded as a decision to initiate the formal investigation procedure within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article 93 of the EC Treaty.
If such a decision is taken before the date of accession, the decision will only come into effect upon the date of accession.
Without prejudice to the procedures concerning existing aid provided for in Article III-168 of the Constitution, aid schemes and individual aid granted in the transport sector, put into effect in a new Member State before the date of accession and still applicable after that date, shall be regarded as existing aid within the meaning of Article III-168(1) of the Constitution subject to the following condition:
the aid measures shall be communicated to the Commission within four months of the date of accession.
This communication shall include information on the legal basis for each measure.
Existing aid measures and plans to grant or alter aids communicated to the Commission prior to the date of accession shall be deemed to have been communicated on the date of accession.
These aid measures shall be regarded as ‘existing’ aid within the meaning of Article III‐168(1) of the Constitution until the end of third year from the date of accession.
The new Member States shall, where necessary, amend these aid measures in order to comply with the guidelines applied by the Commission by the end of the third year from the date of accession at the latest.
After that date, any aid found to be incompatible with those guidelines shall be considered as new aid.
With regard to Romania, paragraph 1(c) shall only apply to aid measures assessed by the Romanian State aid monitoring authority after such date, decided upon by the Commission on the basis of continuous monitoring of the commitments undertaken by Romania in the context of the accession negotiations, that Romania's State aid enforcement record in the period prior to accession has reached a satisfactory level.
Such a satisfactory level shall only be considered to have been reached once Romania has demonstrated the consistent application of full and proper State aid control in relation to all aid measures granted in Romania, including the adoption and the implementation of fully and correctly reasoned decisions by the Romanian State aid monitoring authority containing an accurate assessment of the State aid nature of each measure and a correct application of the compatibility criteria.
The Commission may object, on the ground of serious doubts as to the compatibility with the common market, to any aid measure granted in the pre-accession period between 1 September 2004 and the date fixed in the above Commission decision finding that the enforcement record has reached a satisfactory level.
Such a Commission decision to object to a measure shall be regarded as a decision to initiate the formal investigation procedure within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999.
Where the Commission adopts a negative decision following the initiation of the formal investigation procedure, the Commission shall decide that Romania shall take all necessary measures to effectively recover the aid from the beneficiary.
The aid to be recovered shall include interest at an appropriate rate determined in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 794/2004, and payable from the same date.3.
Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, Part III, Title III, Chapter III, Section 4, Agriculture and fisheries
The said stocks shall be taken over only on condition that public intervention for the products in question is operated in the Community and that the stocks meet the Community intervention requirements.
Any stock of product, private as well as public, in free circulation at the date of accession within the territory of the new Member States exceeding the quantity which could be regarded as constituting a normal carryover of stock must be eliminated at the expense of the new Member States.
The concept of normal carryover stock shall be defined for each product on the basis of criteria and objectives specific to each common market organisation.
The stocks referred to in paragraph 1 shall be deducted from the quantity exceeding the normal carryover of stocks.
The Commission shall implement and apply the arrangements outlined above in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 13 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the financing of the common agricultural policy or, as appropriate, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 42(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 30 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector, or in the corresponding Articles of the other Regulations on the common organisation of agricultural markets or the relevant committee procedure as determined in the applicable legislation.
Without prejudice to the procedures concerning existing aid provided for in Article III-168 of the Constitution, aid schemes and individual aid granted to activities linked to the production, processing or marketing of products listed in Annex I to the Constitution, with the exception of fisheries products and products derived therefrom, put into effect in a new Member State before the date of accession and still applicable after that date, shall be regarded as existing aid within the meaning of Article III-168(1) of the Constitution, subject to the following condition:
The Commission shall publish a list of such aids.
These aid measures shall be regarded as ‘existing’ aid within the meaning of Article III-168(1) of the Constitution until the end of third year from the date of accession.

FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT FOR PERSONS
Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe
31968 R 1612: Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 of the Council of 15 October 1968 on freedom of movement for workers within the Community (OJ L 257, 19.10.1968, p. 2), as last amended by:32004 L 0038: Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29.4.2004 (OJ L 158, 30.4.2004, p. 77);
Directive 96/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1996 concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services (OJ L 18, 21.1.1997, p. 1);
Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States amending Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 and repealing Directives 64/221/EEC, 68/360/EEC, 72/194/EEC, 73/148/EEC, 75/34/EEC, 75/35/EEC, 90/364/EEC, 90/365/EEC and 93/96/EEC (OJ L 158, 30.4.2004, p. 77).
Article III-133 and the first paragraph of Article III-144 of the Constitution shall fully apply only, in relation to the freedom of movement of workers and the freedom to provide services involving temporary movement of workers as defined in Article 1 of Directive 96/71/EC between Bulgaria on the one hand, and each of the present Member States on the other hand, subject to the transitional provisions laid down in paragraphs 2 to 14.
By way of derogation from Articles 1 to 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 and until the end of the two year period following the date of accession, the present Member States will apply national measures, or those resulting from bilateral agreements, regulating access to their labour markets by Bulgarian nationals.
The present Member States may continue to apply such measures until the end of the five year period following the date of accession.
Bulgarian nationals legally working in a present Member State at the date of accession and admitted to the labour market of that Member State for an uninterrupted period of 12 months or longer will enjoy access to the labour market of that Member State but not to the labour market of other Member States applying national measures.
Bulgarian nationals admitted to the labour market of a present Member State following accession for an uninterrupted period of 12 months or longer shall also enjoy the same rights.
The Bulgarian nationals mentioned in the second and third subparagraphs above shall cease to enjoy the rights contained in those subparagraphs if they voluntarily leave the labour market of the present Member State in question.
Bulgarian nationals legally working in a present Member State at the date of accession, or during a period when national measures are applied, and who were admitted to the labour market of that Member State for a period of less than 12 months shall not enjoy these rights.
Before the end of the two year period following the date of accession, the Council shall review the functioning of the transitional provisions laid down in paragraph 2, on the basis of a report from the Commission.
On completion of this review, and no later than at the end of the two year period following the date of accession, the present Member States shall notify the Commission whether they will continue applying national measures or measures resulting from bilateral agreements, or whether they will apply Articles 1 to 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 henceforth.
In the absence of such notification, Articles 1 to 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 shall apply.
Upon the request of Bulgaria, one further review may be held.
The procedure referred to in paragraph 3 shall apply and shall be completed within six months of receipt of the request from Bulgaria.
A Member State maintaining national measures or measures resulting from bilateral agreements at the end of the five year period indicated in paragraph 2 may, in case of serious disturbances of its labour market or threat thereof and after notifying the Commission, continue to apply these measures until the end of the seven year period following the date of accession.
During the seven year period following the date of accession, those Member States in which, by virtue of paragraphs 3, 4 or 5, Articles 1 to 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 apply as regards Bulgarian nationals, and which are issuing work permits to nationals of Bulgaria for monitoring purposes during this period, will do so automatically.
Those Member States in which, by virtue of paragraphs 3, 4 or 5, Articles 1 to 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 apply as regards Bulgarian nationals, may resort to the procedures set out in the subparagraphs below until the end of the seven year period following the date of accession.
When a Member State referred to in the first subparagraph undergoes or foresees disturbances on its labour market which could seriously threaten the standard of living or level of employment in a given region or occupation, that Member State shall inform the Commission and the other Member States thereof and shall supply them with all relevant particulars.
On the basis of this information, the Member State may request the Commission to state that the application of Articles 1 to 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 be wholly or partially suspended in order to restore to normal the situation in that region or occupation.
The Commission shall decide on the suspension and on the duration and scope thereof not later than two weeks after receiving such a request and shall notify the Council of such a decision.
Any Member State may, within two weeks from the date of the Commission's Decision, request the Council to annul or amend the Decision.
The Council shall act on such a request within two weeks, by qualified majority.
A Member State referred to in the first subparagraph may, in urgent and exceptional cases, suspend the application of Articles 1 to 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68, followed by a reasoned ex-post notification to the Commission.
As long as the application of Articles 1 to 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 is suspended by virtue of paragraphs 2 to 5 and 7 above, Article 23 of Directive 2004/38/EC shall apply in Bulgaria with regard to nationals of the present Member States, and in the present Member States with regard to Bulgarian nationals, under the following conditions, so far as the right of family members of workers to take up employment is concerned:
the spouse of a worker and their descendants who are under 21 years of age or are dependants, legally residing with the worker in the territory of a Member State at the date of accession, shall have, upon accession, immediate access to the labour market of that Member State.
This does not apply to family members of a worker legally admitted to the labour market of that Member State for a period of less than 12 months;
the spouse of a worker and their descendants who are under 21 years of age or are dependants, legally residing with the worker in the territory of a Member State from a date later than the date of accession, but during the period of application of the transitional provisions laid down above, shall have access to the labour market of the Member State concerned once they have been resident in the Member State concerned for at least eighteen months or from the third year following the date of accession, whichever is the earlier.
These provisions shall be without prejudice to more favourable measures whether national or resulting from bilateral agreements.
Insofar as provisions of Directive 2004/38/EC which take over provisions of Directive 68/360/EEC may not be dissociated from those of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 whose application is deferred pursuant to paragraphs 2 to 5 and 7 and 8, Bulgaria and the present Member States may derogate from those provisions to the extent necessary for the application of paragraphs 2 to 5 and 7 and 8.
Whenever national measures, or those resulting from bilateral agreements, are applied by the present Member States by virtue of the transitional provisions laid down above, Bulgaria may maintain in force equivalent measures with regard to the nationals of the Member State or States in question.
If the application of Articles 1 to 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 is suspended by any of the present Member States, Bulgaria may resort to the procedures laid down in paragraph 7 with respect to Romania.
During any such period work permits issued by Bulgaria for monitoring purposes to nationals of Romania shall be issued automatically.
Any present Member State applying national measures in accordance with paragraphs 2 to 5 and 7 to 9, may introduce, under national law, greater freedom of movement than that existing at the date of accession, including full labour market access.
From the third year following the date of accession, any present Member State applying national measures may at any time decide to apply Articles 1 to 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 instead.
The Commission shall be informed of any such decision.
In order to address serious disturbances or the threat thereof in specific sensitive service sectors on their labour markets, which could arise in certain regions from the transnational provision of services, as defined in Article 1 of Directive 96/71/EC, and as long as they apply, by virtue of the transitional provisions laid down above, national measures or those resulting from bilateral agreements to the free movement of Bulgarian workers, Germany and Austria may, after notifying the Commission, derogate from the first paragraph of Article III-144 of the Constitution with a view to limit, in the context of the provision of services by companies established in Bulgaria, the temporary movement of workers whose right to take up work in Germany and Austria is subject to national measures.
The list of service sectors which may be covered by this derogation is as follows:
in Germany:
Sector
NACE [2] code, unless otherwise specified
Construction, including related branches
Activities listed in the Annex to Directive 96/71/EC
Industrial cleaning
Other Services
Only activities of interior decorators
in Austria:
NACE [3] code, unless otherwise specified
Horticultural service activities
Cutting, shaping and finishing of stone
Manufacture of metal structures and parts of structures
Security activities
Home nursing
Social work and activities without accommodations
To the extent that Germany or Austria derogate from the first paragraph of Article III-144 of the Constitution in accordance with the preceding subparagraphs, Bulgaria may, after notifying the Commission, take equivalent measures.
The effect of the application of this paragraph shall not result in conditions for the temporary movement of workers in the context of the transnational provision of services between Germany or Austria and Bulgaria which are more restrictive than those prevailing on the date of signature of the Treaty of Accession.
The effect of the application of paragraphs 2 to 5 and 7 to 12 shall not result in conditions for access of Bulgarian nationals to the labour markets of the present Member States which are more restrictive than those prevailing on the date of signature of the Treaty of Accession.
Notwithstanding the application of the provisions laid down in paragraphs 1 to 13, the present Member States shall, during any period when national measures or those resulting from bilateral agreements are applied, give preference to workers who are nationals of the Member States over workers who are nationals of third countries as regards access to their labour market.
Bulgarian migrant workers and their families legally resident and working in another Member State or migrant workers from other Member States and their families legally resident and working in Bulgaria shall not be treated in a more restrictive way than those from third countries resident and working in that Member State or Bulgaria respectively.
Furthermore, in application of the principle of Community preference, migrant workers from third countries resident and working in Bulgaria shall not be treated more favourably than nationals of Bulgaria.
FREEDOM TO PROVIDE SERVICES
Directive 97/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 March 1997 on investor-compensation schemes (OJ L 84, 26.3.1997, p. 22).

During the transitional period the other Member States will retain the right to prevent a branch of a Bulgarian investment firm established on their territories from operating unless and until such a branch has joined an officially recognised investor-compensation scheme within the territory of the Member State concerned in order to cover the difference between the Bulgarian level of compensation and the minimum level referred to in Article 4(1) of Directive 97/9/EC.
FREE MOVEMENT OF CAPITAL
Notwithstanding the obligations under the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, Bulgaria may maintain in force for five years from the date of accession the restrictions laid down in its legislation, existing at the time of signature of the Treaty of Accession, on the acquisition of ownership over land for secondary residences by nationals of the Member States or the States which are a party to the European Economic Area Agreement (EEAA) non-resident in Bulgaria and by legal persons formed in accordance with the laws of another Member State or of an EEAA State.
Nationals of the Member States and nationals of the States which are a party to the European Economic Area Agreement who are legally resident in Bulgaria shall not be subject to the provisions of the preceding subparagraph or to any rules and procedures other than those to which nationals of Bulgaria are subject.

In no instance may a national of a Member State be treated less favourably in respect of the acquisition of agricultural land, forests and forestry land than at the date of signature of the Accession Treaty or be treated in a more restrictive way than a national of a third country.
Self-employed farmers who are nationals of another Member State and who wish to establish themselves and legally reside in Bulgaria, shall not be subject to the provisions of the preceding subparagraph or to any procedures other than those to which nationals of Bulgaria are subject.
A general review of these transitional measures shall be held in the third year following the date of accession.
To this effect, the Commission shall submit a report to the Council.
The Council may, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, decide to shorten or terminate the transitional period indicated in the first subparagraph.

Detailed implementation rules to ensure the smooth operation of the above transitional regime may be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 58 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002.
Council Regulation (EEC) No 3118/93 of 25 October 1993 laying down the conditions under which non-resident carriers may operate national road haulage services within a Member State (OJ L 279, 12.11.1993, p. 1), as last amended by:
Regulation (EC) No 484/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 1.3.2002 (OJ L 76, 19.3.2002, p. 1).
By way of derogation from Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 3118/93 and until the end of the third year following the date of accession, carriers established in Bulgaria shall be excluded from the operation of national road haulage services in the other Member States, and carriers established in the other Member States shall be excluded from the operation of national road haulage services in Bulgaria.
Before the end of the third year following the date of accession, Member States shall notify the Commission whether they will prolong this period for a maximum of two years or whether they will fully apply Article 1 of the Regulation henceforth.
In the absence of such notification, Article 1 of the Regulation shall apply.
Only carriers established in those Member States in which Article 1 of the Regulation applies may perform national road haulage services in those other Member States in which Article 1 also applies.
Those Member States in which, by virtue of paragraph (b) above, Article 1 of the Regulation applies, may resort to the procedure set out below until the end of the fifth year following the date of accession.
When a Member State referred to in the preceding subparagraph undergoes a serious disturbance of its national market or parts thereof due to or aggravated by cabotage, such as serious excess of supply over demand or a threat to the financial stability or survival of a significant number of road haulage undertakings, that Member State shall inform the Commission and the other Member States thereof and shall supply them with all relevant particulars.
On the basis of this information, the Member State may request the Commission to suspend, in whole or in part, the application of Article 1 of the Regulation, in order to restore to normal the situation.
The Commission shall examine the situation on the basis of data provided by the Member State concerned and shall decide within one month of receipt of the request on the need for the adoption of safeguard measures.

As long as Article 1 of the Regulation is not applied by virtue of paragraphs (a) and (b) above, Member States may regulate access to their national road haulage services by progressively exchanging cabotage authorisations on the basis of bilateral agreements.
This may include the possibility of full liberalisation.
The effect of the application of paragraphs (a) to (c) shall not lead to more restrictive access to national road haulage services than that prevailing on the date of signature of the Treaty of Accession.
Council Directive 96/26/EC of 29 April 1996 on admission to the occupation of road haulage operator and road passenger transport operator and mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications intended to facilitate for these operators the right to freedom of establishment in national and international transport operations (OJ L 124, 23.5.1996, p. 1), as last amended by:

Council Directive 96/53/EC of 25 July 1996 laying down for certain road vehicles circulating within the Community the maximum authorised dimensions in national and international traffic and the maximum authorised weights in international traffic (OJ L 235, 17.9.1996, p. 59), as last amended by:
Directive 2002/7/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18.2.2002 (OJ L 67, 9.3.2002, p. 47).
By way of derogation from Article 3(1) of Directive 96/53/EC, vehicles complying with the limit values of categories 3.2.1, 3.4.1, 3.4.2, and 3.5.1 specified in Annex I to that Directive may only use non-upgraded parts of the Bulgarian road network until 31 December 2013 if they comply with Bulgarian axle-weight limits.
As from the date of accession, no restrictions may be imposed on the use, by vehicles complying with the requirements of Directive 96/53/EC, of the main transit routes set out in Annex I to Decision No 1692/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 1996 on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network.Bulgaria shall adhere to the timetable set out in the tables below for the upgrading of its main road network.

As from the date of accession, all vehicles in international traffic fitted with air-suspension complying with the limit values of Directive 96/53/EC shall not be subject to any temporary additional charges on the entire Bulgarian road transport network.
Temporary additional charges for using non-upgraded parts of the network with vehicles in international traffic not fitted with air-suspension and complying with the limit values of the Directive shall be levied in a non-discriminatory manner.
The charging regime shall be transparent, and payment of these charges shall not place an undue administrative burden or delay on the user, nor shall the payment of these charges lead to a systematic check of axle load limits at the border.
Enforcement of axle load limits shall be assured in a non‐discriminatory manner throughout the territory and be effective also as regards vehicles registered in Bulgaria.

ANNEX VII
List referred to in Article 20 of the Protocol: transitional measures, Romania
Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 of the Council of 15 October 1968 on freedom of movement for workers within the Community (OJ L 257, 19.10.1968, p. 2), as last amended by:
Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29.4.2004 (OJ L 158, 30.4.2004, p. 77);
Directive 96/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1996 concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services (OJ L 18, 21.1.1997, p. 1);
Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States amending Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 and repealing Directives 64/221/EEC, 68/360/EEC, 72/194/EEC, 73/148/EEC, 75/34/EEC, 75/35/EEC, 90/364/EEC, 90/365/EEC and 93/96/EEC (OJ L 158, 30.4.2004, p. 77).
Article III-133 and the first paragraph of Article III-144 of the Constitution shall fully apply only, in relation to the freedom of movement of workers and the freedom to provide services involving temporary movement of workers as defined in Article 1 of Directive 96/71/EC between Romania on the one hand, and each of the present Member States on the other hand, subject to the transitional provisions laid down in paragraphs 2 to 14.
By way of derogation from Articles 1 to 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 and until the end of the two year period following the date of accession, the present Member States will apply national measures, or those resulting from bilateral agreements, regulating access to their labour markets by Romanian nationals.
Romanian nationals legally working in a present Member State at the date of accession and admitted to the labour market of that Member State for an uninterrupted period of 12 months or longer will enjoy access to the labour market of that Member State but not to the labour market of other Member States applying national measures.
Romanian nationals admitted to the labour market of a present Member State following accession for an uninterrupted period of 12 months or longer shall also enjoy the same rights.
The Romanian nationals mentioned in the second and third subparagraphs above shall cease to enjoy the rights contained in those subparagraphs if they voluntarily leave the labour market of the present Member State in question.
Romanian nationals legally working in a present Member State at the date of accession, or during a period when national measures are applied, and who were admitted to the labour market of that Member State for a period of less than 12 months shall not enjoy these rights.
Before the end of the two year period following the date of accession, the Council shall review the functioning of the transitional provisions laid down in paragraph 2, on the basis of a report from the Commission.
On completion of this review, and no later than at the end of the two year period following the date of accession, the present Member States shall notify the Commission whether they will continue applying national measures or measures resulting from bilateral agreements, or whether they will apply Articles 1 to 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 henceforth.
In the absence of such notification, Articles 1 to 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 shall apply.
Upon the request of Romania, one further review may be held.
The procedure referred to in paragraph 3 shall apply and shall be completed within six months of receipt of the request from Romania.
A Member State maintaining national measures or measures resulting from bilateral agreements at the end of the five year period indicated in paragraph 2 may, in case of serious disturbances of its labour market or threat thereof and after notifying the Commission, continue to apply these measures until the end of the seven year period following the date of accession.
During the seven year period following the date of accession, those Member States in which, by virtue of paragraph 3, 4 or 5, Articles 1 to 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 apply as regards Romanian nationals, and which are issuing work permits to nationals of Romania for monitoring purposes during this period, will do so automatically.
Those Member States in which, by virtue of paragraphs 3, 4 or 5, Articles 1 to 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 apply as regards Romanian nationals, may resort to the procedures set out in the subparagraphs below until the end of the seven year period following the date of accession.
On the basis of this information, the Member State may request the Commission to state that the application of Articles 1 to 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 be wholly or partially suspended in order to restore to normal the situation in that region or occupation.
A Member State referred to in the first subparagraph may, in urgent and exceptional cases, suspend the application of Articles 1 to 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68, followed by a reasoned ex-post notification to the Commission.
As long as the application of Articles 1 to 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 is suspended by virtue of paragraphs 2 to 5 and 7 above, Article 23 of Directive 2004/38/EC shall apply in Romania with regard to nationals of the present Member States, and in the present Member States with regard to Romanian nationals, under the following conditions, so far as the right of family members of workers to take up employment is concerned:
Insofar as provisions of Directive 2004/38/EC which take over provisions of Directive 68/360/EEC may not be dissociated from those of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 whose application is deferred pursuant to paragraphs 2 to 5 and 7 and 8, Romania and the present Member States may derogate from those provisions to the extent necessary for the application of paragraphs 2 to 5 and 7 and 8.
Whenever national measures, or those resulting from bilateral agreements, are applied by the present Member States by virtue of the transitional provisions laid down above, Romania may maintain in force equivalent measures with regard to the nationals of the Member State or States in question.
If the application of Articles 1 to 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 is suspended by any of the present Member States, Romania may resort to the procedures laid down in paragraph 7 with respect to Bulgaria.
During any such period work permits issued by Romania for monitoring purposes to nationals of Bulgaria shall be issued automatically.
Any present Member State applying national measures in accordance with paragraphs 2 to 5 and 7 to 9, may introduce, under national law, greater freedom of movement than that existing at the date of accession, including full labour market access.
From the third year following the date of accession, any present Member State applying national measures may at any time decide to apply Articles 1 to 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 instead.
In order to address serious disturbances or the threat thereof in specific sensitive service sectors on their labour markets, which could arise in certain regions from the transnational provision of services, as defined in Article 1 of Directive 96/71/EC, and as long as they apply, by virtue of the transitional provisions laid down above, national measures or those resulting from bilateral agreements to the free movement of Romanian workers, Germany and Austria may, after notifying the Commission, derogate from the first paragraph of Article III-144 of the Constitution with a view to limit, in the context of the provision of services by companies established in Romania, the temporary movement of workers whose right to take up work in Germany and Austria is subject to national measures.
Activities listed in the Annex to Directive 96/71/EC
To the extent that Germany or Austria derogate from the first paragraph of Article III-144 of the Constitution in accordance with the preceding subparagraphs, Romania may, after notifying the Commission, take equivalent measures.
The effect of the application of this paragraph shall not result in conditions for the temporary movement of workers in the context of the transnational provision of services between Germany or Austria and Romania which are more restrictive than those prevailing on the date of signature of the Treaty of Accession.
The effect of the application of paragraphs 2 to 5 and 7 to 12 shall not result in conditions for access of Romanian nationals to the labour markets of the present Member States which are more restrictive than those prevailing on the date of signature of the Treaty of Accession.
Notwithstanding the application of the provisions laid down in paragraphs 1 to 13, the present Member States shall, during any period when national measures or those resulting from bilateral agreements are applied, give preference to workers who are nationals of the Member States over workers who are nationals of third countries as regards access to their labour market.
Romanian migrant workers and their families legally resident and working in another Member State or migrant workers from other Member States and their families legally resident and working in Romania shall not be treated in a more restrictive way than those from third countries resident and working in that Member State or Romania respectively.
Furthermore, in application of the principle of Community preference, migrant workers from third countries resident and working in Romania shall not be treated more favourably than nationals of Romania.
Directive 97/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 March 1997 on investor-compensation schemes (OJ L 84, 26.3.1997, p. 22).
By way of derogation from Article 4(1) of Directive 97/9/EC, the minimum level of compensation shall not apply in Romania until 31 December 2011.
Romania shall ensure that its investor‐compensation scheme provides for cover of not less than EUR 4500 from 1 January 2007 until 31 December 2007, of not less than EUR 7000 from 1 January 2008 until 31 December 2008, of not less than EUR 9000 from 1 January 2009 until 31 December 2009, of not less than EUR 11000 from 1 January 2010 until 31 December 2010 and of not less than EUR 15000 from 1 January 2011 until 31 December 2011.
During the transitional period the other Member States will retain the right to prevent a branch of a Romanian investment firm established on their territories from operating unless and until such a branch has joined an officially recognised investor-compensation scheme within the territory of the Member State concerned in order to cover the difference between the Romanian level of compensation and the minimum level referred to in Article 4(1) of Directive 97/9/EC.

no State aid for restructuring is granted or paid to the Romanian steel sector after 31 December 2004.
For the purpose of these provisions and Appendix A, State aid for restructuring is to be understood as any measure concerning steel companies that constitutes State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty and that cannot be held to be compatible with the common market in accordance with the normal rules applied in the Community.
Only the companies listed in Appendix A, Part I, (hereinafter referred to as the ‘benefiting companies’) shall be eligible for State aid in the framework of the Romanian steel restructuring programme.
Restructuring of the Romanian steel sector, as described in the individual business plans of the benefiting companies and in the national restructuring programme, and in line with the conditions set out in these provisions and in Appendix A, shall be completed no later than 31 December 2008 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the end of the restructuring period’).

Companies not listed as ‘benefiting companies’ under Appendix A, Part I, shall not benefit from State aid for restructuring or any other aid not deemed compatible with Community State aid rules and shall not be required to reduce capacity in this context.
Any capacity cuts within these companies shall not count towards the minimum reduction.
The total amount of gross restructuring aid to be approved for the benefiting companies shall be determined by the justifications for each and every aid measure provided in the final national restructuring programme and individual business plans to be approved by the Romanian authorities and subject to final verification of fulfilment of the criteria laid out in Article 9(4) of Protocol 2 to the Europe Agreement and approval by the Council.

The viability shall be determined taking into account the benchmarks described in Appendix A, Part III.
No further State aid shall be granted by Romania for restructuring purposes to the Romanian steel industry.
The total net capacity reductions for finished products to be achieved by the benefiting companies during the period 1993-2008 shall be a minimum of 2,05 million tonnes.
These capacity reductions shall be measured on the basis of permanent closure by physical destruction of the hot-rolled steel facilities concerned, such that the facilities cannot be restored to service.

Any subsequent changes in the national restructuring programme and the individual business plans must be agreed by the Commission, and where appropriate, by the Council.
The implementation of the restructuring shall take place under conditions of full transparency and on the basis of sound market economy principles.
For this purpose, the Commission shall report to the Council.
Monitoring shall include an independent evaluation to be carried out annually in each of the years 2005 to 2009.
Romania shall cooperate fully with all the arrangements for monitoring.
In particular:
Romania shall submit 6-monthly reports to the Commission no later than 15 March and 15 September of each year, unless the Commission decides otherwise.
The first report is to be submitted on 15 March 2005 and the last on 15 March 2009; these reports shall contain all the information necessary to monitor the restructuring process and the reduction and use of capacity and shall provide sufficient financial data to allow an assessment to be made of whether the conditions and requirements contained in these provisions and in Appendix A have been fulfilled.
The reports shall at the least contain the information set out in Appendix A, Part IV, which the Commission reserves the right to modify in line with its experience during the monitoring process.
In addition to the individual business reports of the benefiting companies, there shall also be a report on the overall situation of the Romanian steel sector, including recent macroeconomic developments;
Romania shall oblige the benefiting companies to disclose all relevant data which might, under other circumstances, be considered as confidential.
In its reporting to the Council, the Commission shall ensure that company-specific confidential information is not disclosed.
A Consultative Committee consisting of representatives of the Romanian authorities and of the Commission shall meet on a 6-monthly basis.
Meetings of this Consultative Committee may also take place on an ad hoc basis if deemed necessary by the Commission.
If the Commission establishes, on the basis of the monitoring, that substantial deviations from the forecasts of the macroeconomic developments, the financial situation of the benefiting companies or the viability assessment have occurred, it may require Romania to take appropriate measures to reinforce or modify the restructuring measures of the benefiting companies concerned.
Should the monitoring show that:
any of the conditions laid down in these provisions and in Appendix A have not been fulfilled, or
any of the commitments made by Romania in the framework of the extension of the period during which Romania may exceptionally grant State aid for the restructuring of its steel industry under the Europe Agreement have not been fulfilled, or
in the course of the restructuring period Romania has granted additional incompatible State aid to the benefiting companies or to any steel company,
the Commission shall take the appropriate steps requiring any company concerned to reimburse any aid granted in breach of the conditions laid down in these provisions and in Appendix A. Where necessary, recourse to the safeguard clauses as laid down in Article 37 of the Protocol or under Article 39 of the Protocol shall be made.

ANNEX VIII
Rural development (referred to in Article 34 of the Protocol)
SECTION I
TEMPORARY ADDITIONAL RURAL DEVELOPMENT MEASURES FOR BULGARIA AND ROMANIA
Support for semi‐subsistence farms undergoing restructuring
Support for semi‐subsistence farms undergoing restructuring shall contribute to the following objectives:
to help ease rural transition problems as the agricultural sector and rural economy of Bulgaria and Romania are exposed to the competitive pressure of the single market;
to facilitate and encourage the restructuring of farms not yet economically viable.
For the purpose of this Annex, ‘semi‐subsistence farms’ shall mean farms which primarily produce for their own consumption, but also market a proportion of their output.
To benefit from the support, the farmer must present a business plan which:
demonstrates the future economic viability of the farm;
contains details of the investments required;
describes specific milestones and targets.
Compliance with the business plan referred to in point (2) shall be reviewed after three years.
If the interim objectives set out in the plan have not been achieved by the time of the three‐year review, no further support shall be granted but there will be no requirement on these grounds to repay monies already received.
Support shall be paid annually in the form of a flat-rate aid up to the maximum eligible amount specified in Section I G and for a period not exceeding five years.
Producer groups
Flat‐rate support shall be granted in order to facilitate the establishment and administrative operation of producer groups which have as their objectives:
adapting the production and output of the producers who are members of such groups to market requirements;
jointly placing goods on the market, including preparation for sale, the centralisation of sales and supply to bulk buyers; and
establishing common rules on production information, with particular regard to harvesting and availability.
The support shall be granted only to producer groups which are formally recognised by the competent authorities of Bulgaria or Romania between the date of accession and 31 December 2009 on the basis of either national or Community law.
The support shall be granted in annual instalments for the first five years following the date on which the producer group was recognised.
It shall be calculated on the basis of the group's annual marketed production and shall not exceed:
5 %, 5 %, 4 %, 3 % and 2 % of the value of the production up to EUR 1000000 marketed respectively in the first, second, third, fourth and fifth year, and
2,5 %, 2,5 %, 2,0 %, 1,5 % and 1,5 % of the value of the production exceeding EUR 1000000 marketed respectively in the first, second, third, fourth and fifth year.
In any case, support shall not exceed the maximum eligible amounts laid down in Section I G.
Leader + type measures
Support may be granted for measures which are related to the acquisition of skills intended to prepare rural communities to conceive and implement local rural development strategies.
These measures may include in particular:
technical support for studies of the local area, and territory diagnosis taking into account the wishes expressed by the population concerned;
information and training of the population to encourage an active participation in the development process;
building representative local development partnerships;
drawing up integrated development strategies;
financing research and preparing applications for support.
Support may be granted for the adoption of integrated territorial rural development strategies, of a pilot nature, prepared by local action groups in accordance with the principles laid down in items 12, 14 and 36 of the Commission Notice to the Member States of 14 April 2000 laying down guidelines for the Community initiative for rural development (Leader+).
This support shall be limited to regions where there is already sufficient administrative capacity and experience of local rural development type approaches.
The local action groups referred to in point (2) may be eligible to participate in inter-territorial and transnational cooperation actions in accordance with the principles laid down in items 15 to 18 of the Commission Notice referred to in point (2).
Bulgaria and Romania and local action groups shall be given access to the Observatory of rural areas provided for in item 23 of the Commission Notice referred to in point (2).
Farm advisory and extension services
Support shall be granted for the provision of farm advisory and extension services.
Complements to direct payments
Support may be granted to farmers eligible for complementary national direct payments or aids under Article 143c of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003.
The support granted to a farmer in respect of the years 2007, 2008, 2009 shall not exceed the difference between:
the level of direct payments applicable in Bulgaria or Romania for the year concerned in accordance with Article 143a of Regulation (EC) 1782/2003, and
40 % of the level of direct payments applicable in the Community as constituted on 30 April 2004 in the relevant year.
The Community contribution to support granted under this subsection E in Bulgaria or Romania in respect of each of the years 2007, 2008, and 2009 shall not exceed 20 % of its respective annual allocation.
However Bulgaria or Romania may decide to replace this 20 % annual rate with the following rates: 25 % for 2007, 20 % for 2008 and 15 % for 2009.
Support granted to a farmer under this subsection E shall be counted as complementary national direct payments or aids, as applicable, for the purposes of applying the maximum levels set out in Article 143c(2a) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003.
Technical assistance
Support may be granted for the preparation, monitoring, evaluation and control measures which are necessary for the implementation of the rural development programming documents.
The measures referred to in point (1) shall include in particular:
studies;
measures of technical assistance, the exchange of experience and information aimed at partners, beneficiaries and the general public;
installation, operation and interconnection of computerised systems for management, monitoring and evaluation;
improvements in evaluation methods and exchange of information on best practice in this field.

ANNEX IX
Specific commitments undertaken, and requirements accepted, by Romania at the conclusion of the accession negotiations on 14 December 2004 (referred to in Article 39 of the Protocol)
I. In relation to Article 39(2)
To implement without further delay the Schengen Action Plan, as published in M.Of., p. I, nr. 129 bis/10.II.2005, amended in line with the acquis and in accordance with the deadlines agreed upon.
In order to ensure a high level of control and surveillance at the future external borders of the Union, to speed up considerably efforts in terms of modernising equipment and infrastructure at the green border, blue border and at border crossing points, and to further enhance the capacity of operational risk analysis.
This must be reflected in one single multi-annual investment plan to be tabled no later than March 2005, which must allow the Union to measure progress on a yearly basis and until the decision referred to in Article 4(2) of the Protocol is taken in respect of Romania.

DECLARATIONS
JOINT DECLARATIONS BY THE PRESENT MEMBER STATES
Joint declaration on the free movement of workers: Bulgaria
The European Union stresses the strong elements of differentiation and flexibility in the arrangement for the free movement of workers.
Member States shall endeavour to grant increased labour market access to Bulgarian nationals under national law, with a view to speeding up the approximation to the acquis.
As a consequence, the employment opportunities in the European Union for Bulgarian nationals should improve substantially upon Bulgaria's accession.
Moreover, the EU Member States will make best use of the proposed arrangement to move as quickly as possible to the full application of the acquis in the area of free movement of workers.
Joint declaration on grain legumes: Bulgaria
With regard to grain legumes an area of 18047 ha has been taken into account for the calculation of Bulgaria's national ceiling in Annex VIIIA to Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 (OJ L 270, 21.10.2003, p. 1).
Joint declaration on the free movement of workers: Romania
Member States shall endeavour to grant increased labour market access to Romanian nationals under national law, with a view to speeding up the approximation to the acquis.
As a consequence, the employment opportunities in the European Union for Romanian nationals should improve substantially upon Romania's accession.

With regard to the commitment appropriations for rural development originating from the EAGGF Guarantee Section for Bulgaria and Romania over the three-year period 2007‐2009 mentioned in Article 34(2) of the Accession Protocol and Article 34(2) of the Act of Accession, the Union notes that the following allocations can be expected:
Bulgaria's and Romania's rural development allocations beyond the three year period 2007‐2009 will be based on application of existing rules or those rules deriving from any policy reforms taking place in the meantime.
JOINT DECLARATION BY THE PRESENT MEMBER STATES AND THE COMMISSION
Joint declaration on Bulgaria's and Romania's preparations for accession
The European Union will continue to monitor closely Bulgaria's and Romania's preparations and achievements, including the effective implementation of the commitments undertaken in all areas of the acquis.
The European Union recalls the Presidency Conclusions of the European Council of 16/17 December 2004, in particular under points 8 and 12, underlining that, in the case of Romania, particular attention will be paid to preparation in the areas of Justice and Home Affairs, Competition and Environment, and that in the case of Bulgaria, particular attention will be paid to preparation in the area of Justice and Home Affairs.
The Commission will continue to submit annual reports on Bulgaria's and Romania's progress towards accession, together with recommendations if appropriate.
The European Union recalls that safeguard clauses provide for measures to address serious problems that may arise, as the case may be, before accession or in the three years after accession.
JOINT DECLARATION BY VARIOUS PRESENT MEMBER STATES
Joint declaration by the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Austria on the free movement of workers: Bulgaria and Romania
The wording of point 13 of the transitional measures on the free movement of workers under Directive 96/71/EC in Annexes VI and VII to both the Accession Protocol and the Act of Accession is understood by the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Austria in agreement with the Commission as meaning that ‘certain regions’ may, where appropriate, also comprise the entire national territory.
DECLARATION BY THE REPUBLIC OF BULGARIA
Declaration by the Republic of Bulgaria on the use of the cyrillic alphabet in the European Union
With the recognition of Bulgarian as an authentic language of the Treaties as well as an official and working language to be used by the institutions of the European Union, the Cyrillic alphabet will become one of the three alphabets officially used in the European Union.
This substantial part of the cultural heritage of Europe represents a particular Bulgarian contribution to the linguistic and cultural diversity of the Union.

PROTOCOL 24
on cooperation in the field of control of concentrations
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The EFTA Surveillance Authority and the EC Commission shall exchange information and consult each other on general policy issues at the request of either of the surveillance authorities.
In cases falling under Article 57(2)(a) of the Agreement, the EC Commission and the EFTA Surveillance Authority shall cooperate in the handling of concentrations as provided for in the provisions set out below.
For the purposes of this Protocol, the term “territory of a surveillance authority” shall mean for the EC Commission the territory of the EC Member States to which the Treaty establishing the European Community applies, upon the terms laid down in that Treaty, and for the EFTA Surveillance Authority the territories of the EFTA States to which the Agreement applies.
Cooperation shall take place, in accordance with the provisions set out in this Protocol, where:
the combined turnover of the undertakings concerned in the territory of the EFTA States equals 25 % or more of their total turnover within the territory covered by the Agreement; or
each of at least two of the undertakings concerned has a turnover exceeding EUR 250 million in the territory of the EFTA States; or
the concentration is liable to significantly impede effective competition, in the territories of the EFTA States or a substantial part thereof, in particular as a result of the creation or strengthening of a dominant position.
Cooperation shall also take place where:
the concentration fulfils the criteria for referral pursuant to Article 6.
an EFTA State wishes to adopt measures to protect legitimate interests as set out in Article 7.
INITIAL PHASE OF THE PROCEEDINGS
The EC Commission shall transmit to the EFTA Surveillance Authority copies of notifications of the cases referred to in Article 2(1) and (2)(a) within three working days and, as soon as possible, copies of the most important documents lodged with or issued by the EC Commission.
The EC Commission shall carry out the procedures set out for the implementation of Article 57 of the Agreement in close and constant liaison with the EFTA Surveillance Authority.
The EFTA Surveillance Authority and EFTA States may express their views upon those procedures.
For the purposes of Article 6(1) of this Protocol, the EC Commission shall obtain information from the competent authority of the EFTA State concerned and give it the opportunity to make known its views at every stage of the procedures up to the adoption of a decision pursuant to that Article.
To that end, the EC Commission shall give it access to the file.
Documents to be transmitted from the Commission to an EFTA State and from an EFTA State to the Commission pursuant to this Protocol shall be submitted via the EFTA Surveillance Authority.
HEARINGS
In cases referred to in Article 2(1) and (2)(a), the EC Commission shall invite the EFTA Surveillance Authority to be represented at the hearings of the undertakings concerned.
The EFTA States may likewise be represented at those hearings.
THE EC ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON CONCENTRATIONS
In cases referred to in Article 2(1) and (2)(a), the EC Commission shall in due time inform the EFTA Surveillance Authority of the date of the meeting of the EC Advisory Committee on Concentrations and transmit the relevant documentation.
All documents forwarded for that purpose from the EFTA Surveillance Authority, including documents emanating from EFTA States, shall be presented to the EC Advisory Committee on Concentrations together with the other relevant documentation sent out by the EC Commission.
The EFTA Surveillance Authority and the EFTA States shall be entitled to be present in the EC Advisory Committee on Concentrations and to express their views therein; they shall not have, however, the right to vote.
RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUAL STATES
The EC Commission may, by means of a decision notified without delay to the undertakings concerned, to the competent authorities of the EC Member States and to the EFTA Surveillance Authority, refer a notified concentration, in whole or in part, to an EFTA State where:
a concentration threatens to affect significantly competition in a market within that EFTA State, which presents all the characteristics of a distinct market, or
a concentration affects competition in a market within that EFTA State, which presents all the characteristics of a distinct market and which does not constitute a substantial part of the territory covered by the Agreement.
In cases referred to in paragraph 1, any EFTA State may appeal to the Court of Justice of the European Communities, on the same grounds and conditions as an EC Member State under Articles 230 and 243 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular request the application of interim measures, for the purpose of applying its national competition law.
(No text)
Prior to the notification of a concentration within the meaning of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 the persons or undertakings referred to in Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 may inform the EC Commission, by means of a reasoned submission, that the concentration may significantly affect competition in a market within an EFTA State which presents all the characteristics of a distinct market and should therefore be examined, in whole or in part, by that EFTA State.
The EC Commission shall transmit all submissions pursuant to Article 4(4) of Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 and this paragraph to the EFTA Surveillance Authority without delay.
With regard to a concentration as defined in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 which does not have a Community dimension within the meaning of Article 1 of that Regulation and which is capable of being reviewed under the national competition laws of at least three EC Member States and at least one EFTA State, the persons or undertakings referred to in Article 4(2) of that Regulation may, before any notification to the competent authorities, inform the EC Commission by means of a reasoned submission that the concentration should be examined by the Commission.
The EC Commission shall transmit all submissions pursuant to Article 4(5) of Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 to the EFTA Surveillance Authority without delay.
Where at least one such EFTA State has expressed its disagreement as regards the request to refer the case, the competent EFTA State(s) shall retain their competence, and the case shall not be referred from the EFTA States pursuant to this paragraph.
Notwithstanding the sole competence of the EC Commission to deal with concentrations of a Community dimension as set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004, EFTA States may take appropriate measures to protect legitimate interests other than those taken into consideration according to the above Regulation and compatible with the general principles and other provisions as provided for, directly or indirectly, under the Agreement.
Public security, plurality of media and prudential rules shall be regarded as legitimate interests within the meaning of paragraph 1.
Any other public interest must be communicated to the EC Commission and shall be recognised by the EC Commission after an assessment of its compatibility with the general principles and other provisions as provided for, directly or indirectly, under the Agreement before the measures referred to above may be taken.
The EC Commission shall inform the EFTA Surveillance Authority and the EFTA State concerned of its decision within 25 working days of that communication.

Where the EC Commission carries out investigations within the territory of the Community, it shall, as regards cases falling under Article 2(1) and (2)(a), inform the EFTA Surveillance Authority of the fact that such investigations have taken place and on request transmit in an appropriate way the relevant results of the investigations.
